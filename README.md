Image Generation for Medical Applications :
The purpose of this work is to enhance the original dataset using the diffusion model, which will help the Norberg Angle prediction model perform better.
The goal of this study is to use the diffusion model to enhance the original dataset, ultimately boosting the performance of the Norberg Angle prediction model. The Norberg Angle is depicted in the figure below. The study included fine-tuning the DALL-E, DreamBooth, and Stable Diffusion models to generate high-quality images. 
Our dataset consists of 1047 real-world images and 1474 generated images. To prevent data leakage and ensure an unbiased evaluation, we carefully divided the dataset into separate training, testing, and validation sets.This selection strategy ensures that the training data encompasses a diverse range of visual contexts, promoting robust model learning and adaptation.
